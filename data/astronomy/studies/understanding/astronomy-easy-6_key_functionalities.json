    "Sort the records by epoch and, for each analysis window, choose a start record (first record at/after the window start or the latest just before it) and an end record (last record at/before the window end that is after the chosen start record).",
    "Convert the MEAN_MOTION value of each chosen record from revolutions per day to radians per second, then apply Kepler\u2019s third law (a = (mu / n\u00b2)^(1/3)) with mu = 398 600.4418 km\u00b3/s\u00b2 to obtain the satellite\u2019s semi-major axis in kilometres.",

    "Calculate the average semi-major-axis decay rate for the period as (\u0394a / \u0394t) in km/day (a negative number indicates decay).",
    "Repeat the selection and calculation steps for the quiet and storm windows and print the two resulting rates as (average_quiet_rate_km_day, average_storm_rate_km_day)."
