    "Read Kp index and solar-wind dynamic pressure text files; parse year, day-of-year and hour using datetime datetimes, build a unified hourlytime index",
    "Scale Kp values by dividing by 10 and resample both Kp and Pdyn series to 1-hour means.",
    "Open Swarm Alpha ACCACAL CDF file, extract epoch times and the along-track calibrated acceleration component, convert epochs to datetimes and resample to 1-hour means.",
    "Merge the hourly acceleration, Kp and Pdyn DataFrames on their datetime index with an inner join on the time and drop any rows that still contain NaNs.",
    "Create the forecasting target by shifting the along-track acceleration column \u22123 hours (so inputs at t predict acceleration at t+3 h) and drop resulting NaNs.",
    "Form two single-column feature matrices: one with Kp values and one with Pdyn values; define the shifted acceleration as y.",
    "Split the rows chronologically into training and test sets for all three arrays to preserve time order.",
    "Fit an ordinary least-squares LinearRegression model on the Kp feature and another on the Pdyn feature using the training portion.",
    "Generate test-set predictions for each model and compute the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between y_test and each prediction.",
    "Return / print the two RMSE numbers in the required list order: [RMSE for Kp model, RMSE for Pdyn model]."
