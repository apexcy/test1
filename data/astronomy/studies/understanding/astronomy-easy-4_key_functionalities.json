    "Get integer year by flooring the potentially fractional Year values (e.g., 1960.5 \u279c 1960).",
    "Filter the data frame to retain only rows whose integer year falls between 1960 and 2020, inclusive.",
    "Extract the year and mean sunspot number arrays from the filtered data for analysis.",
    "On the sunspot series, locate maxima with a prominence \u226520 and a minimum separation of 5 years; record their indices, years, and values.",
    "On the sunspot series, locate minima (troughs) under identical prominence and distance requirements.",
    "Compute the average solar\u2010cycle period by taking the mean difference between successive minima years if at least two minima exist.",
    "Report (print) the calculated average period along with the years and sunspot numbers of all detected maxima and minima, effectively highlighting the top solar activity highs and lows in 1960-2020."
