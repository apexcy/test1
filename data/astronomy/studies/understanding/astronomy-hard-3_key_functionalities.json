    "For every TLE, compute the semi-major axis in kilometres using the satellite mean motion and Earth\u2019s gravitational parameter \u03bc = 398 600.4418 km\u00b3 s\u207b\u00b2, and store the result together with the TLE epoch.",

    "Compute the change in semi-major axis between successive TLEs, handling edge cases.",
    "Round every TLE epoch to the nearest hour so that it aligns with the hourly AP grid; if more than one TLE lands in the same hour, average their semi-major-axis changes.",
    "Create two aligned hourly time-series: (1) the rounded-and-averaged semi-major-axis change and (2) the AP index.",
    "For each candidate lag from 0 to 47 hours, shift the AP series forward by that lag so that an AP value at t is compared to a semi-major-axis change at t + lag, inner-join the two series, and compute their Pearson correlation r; square r to obtain r\u00b2.",
    "Track the lag that yields the maximum r\u00b2, skipping any lag where fewer than two overlapping points exist, and finally print the best lag together with its r\u00b2 value."
