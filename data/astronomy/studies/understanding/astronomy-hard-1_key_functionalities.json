    "Scan OMNI2, GOES and Swarm-density folders, pick the csv files whose date ranges overlap the requested training (wu334) and test (wu335) windows.",
    "Read each selected csv with Timestamp parsing, keep the required OMNI2 columns (f10.7_index, Kp_index, Dst_index_nT) and GOES columns (xrsb_flux_observed, xrsa_flux_observed); divide Kp_index by 10 to restore its usual scale.",
    "Merge OMNI2 and GOES data on Timestamp, sort and resample to 1-hour means so that every hour has a single row of the five driving variables; resample Swarm Alpha density to the same 1-hour grid in a separate dataframe.",
    "Within each 16-hour context ending at the last OMNI/GOES time stamp, solve a VAR(1) least-squares problem (Y = A\u00b7X) to obtain a 5\u00d75 coefficient matrix for the five drivers.",
    "Iteratively propagate the last observed driver vector through the VAR(1) model to generate driver forecasts for the following 4 hours of density values that begin one hour after that stamp.",
    "Create a feature matrix from these 4 propagated driver vectors (one row per forecast hour); apply a PolynomialFeatures(degree=1) transformer (effectively a pass-through) to feed a LinearRegression model.",
    "Train the linear regression on wu334 by mapping the projected driver features to the actual Swarm density values observed in the 4-hour target window.",
    "Apply the trained regression to the projected drivers of wu335 to obtain 4-hour density predictions and compute the root-mean-square error (RMSE) against the corresponding observed density values.",
    "Report the RMSE; helper routines raise clear errors if required files, columns or data coverage are missing."
