    "Loop over each year from 2019 to 2023 and read the corresponding water-quality CSV file.",
    "Filter the data to keep only records whose 'Beach Name' contains the word 'Wollaston', using na=False so missing names do not raise errors.",
    "Transform the 'Violation' column to lowercase and flag rows equal to 'yes' to identify tests that exceeded swimming-quality standards.",
    "For each year compute the exceedance rate as (# of violations) \u00f7 (total Wollaston records); if a year has no records, set the rate to 0 to avoid division by zero.",
    "Store the yearly rates, take their mean, and calculate 1 \u2212 mean_rate to obtain the overall fraction of time the beach met standards across 2019\u20132023.",
    "Convert that fraction to a percentage (integer format when printed) and display the result."
