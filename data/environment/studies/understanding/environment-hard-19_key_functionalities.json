    "Loop through water-body testing files from 2002-2023, keep only rows where 'Beach Type Description' == 'Marine'.",
    "Within those marine rows, count violations ('Violation' equal to 'yes') and divide by total marine rows to get yearly exceedance rate.",
    "Build an array of those yearly rates, take absolute year-to-year differences (np.diff), and locate the index of the maximum jump; convert that index to the calendar year (argmax + start_year + 1).",
    "Read Boston and Chatham monthly precipitation CSVs, keep rows 2-23 so years align to 2002-2023, and retain only the columns 'Year', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug'.",
    "For each month in each file, treat the string 'M' as missing, cast the column to float, and impute missing values with the column\u2019s median value.",
    "Compute a row-wise summer total (Jun+Jul+Aug) for each city, then sum Boston and Chatham totals to obtain a single rainfall total per year.",
    "Create an array of these combined yearly rainfall totals, take absolute year-to-year differences, and find the year with the largest change (argmax + start_year + 1).",
    "Compare the two identified years (largest exceedance-rate jump vs. largest rainfall jump); print True if they are identical, otherwise False."
