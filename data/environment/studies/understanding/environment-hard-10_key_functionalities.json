    "Load the environmental-justice populations file and keep only municipalities where the 'Percent of population in EJ BGs' column exceeds 90 %.  Collect these municipality names for later filtering.",
    "Read the 2023 water-body testing file, keep only rows whose 'Beach Type Description' is 'Marine', then keep only beaches whose 'Community' is in the > 90 % EJ municipality list.  Clean beach names by dropping the text that follows the '@' character.",
    "Read the Wollaston Beach daily datasheet CSV after verifying the file exists.  Skip the first row and use the next two rows as a multi-level header.",
    "Flatten that multi-level header by forward-filling missing top-level entries, joining the two header levels with an underscore, and stripping white-space.",
    "Reshape the datasheet from wide to long: treat all columns that contain either 'Tag' or 'Enterococcus' as value columns, melt everything else as identifiers, then split the combined header into separate 'Location' and 'Measure' parts.",
    "Pivot the long data back to tidy wide form so each record contains numeric columns such as '1-Day Rain', '2-Day Rain', '3-Day Rain', and 'Enterococcus', converting all non-identifier fields to numeric with coercion of bad values to NaN.",
    "Create a new 'Total Rain' column by summing the three individual rain columns; although created, the correlation is actually taken only between the existing '3-Day Rain' column and 'Enterococcus'.",
    "Compute the Pearson correlation between '3-Day Rain' and 'Enterococcus' for the EJ community beach data and print the value rounded to two decimal places."
