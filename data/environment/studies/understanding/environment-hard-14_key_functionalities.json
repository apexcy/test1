    "For Marine rainfall: read the monthly_precipitations_*.csv files for Boston and Chatham; keep Year + summer-month columns, keep only 2007\u20132009 rows, cast month columns to float, sum Jun+Jul+Aug per year to get a summer total, then average the two cities\u2019 totals year-wise to obtain a (3-value) marine_rains array.",
    "For Fresh rainfall: repeat the same procedure for Boston, Chatham, Amherst and Ashburnham, then average the four cities year-wise to obtain a (3-value) fresh_rains array.",
    "Use numpy.corrcoef to calculate the Pearson correlation between the 3-year exceedance-rate vector and the 3-year rainfall vector for Marine beaches; repeat for Fresh beaches.",
