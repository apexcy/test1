    "Identify columns that contain measurements (those whose name includes \"Tag\" or \"Enterococcus\") versus identifying columns (all others); reshape the table from wide to long with melt, so each measurement becomes a row.",
    "Split the combined header in the long table into separate 'Location' and 'Measure' fields, then pivot back to a tidy wide format with one row per sample-location and separate columns for each measure.",
    "Convert all measure columns (e.g., Enterococcus counts and rainfall totals) to numeric, coercing non-numeric entries to NaN.",
    "Remove rows whose Location equals \"Castle Island Playground\" so only Pleasure Bay samples remain.",
