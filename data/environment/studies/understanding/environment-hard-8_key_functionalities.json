    "Flatten the two-level header by forward-filling empty first-level cells, then join the two levels with an underscore so each measurement becomes a single column name.",
    "Separate measurement columns (those containing 'Tag' or 'Enterococcus'); treat everything else as identifying columns (date, time, etc.).",
    "Reshape: melt the dataframe to long form on the measurement columns, parse the combined column into 'Location' and 'Measure', then pivot back so each row has separate numeric columns like Enterococcus and 1-Day Rain.",
    "Cast all measurement columns to numeric with errors coerced to NaN to ensure proper comparisons.",
    "For each beach: filter rows where Enterococcus is greater than 104 to count total exceedances (fails).",
    "Within those exceedances, further filter to rows where 1-Day Rain is greater than 0 to count failures that had rainfall in the previous 24 hours.",
    "Accumulate counts across all beaches and finally compute the percentage = (rain-related exceedances \u00f7 total exceedances) \u00d7 100, printing the value rounded to two decimal places."
